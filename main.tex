My heartfelt gratitude to my supervisor Dr. Seema Sharma for her valuable guidance throughout my doctoral thesis project. She has provided 
me many opportunities and freedom to explore new ideas, and interact with experts in the field. I am very thankful to her for her valuable 
advises and helping me all these years of my PhD.

I would like to thank Prof. Gobinda Majumder for sharing his experience and insight to understand forward hadron calorimeter. This was my 
first project in experimental high energy physics, and gave me a good kick start to move towards my thesis project. 

I would like to thank Dr. Andrew Whitbeck, who has been a wonderful collaborator, for his invaluable support to make this a very learning 
experience through his skills and physics insight. I owe a big thanks to Dr. Andrew Whitbeck and Dr. Kevin Pedro for all the help during 
the physics analysis, and to make it an enjoyable and successful journey. I would also like to thank Dr. Giovanni Zevi Della Porta for a 
possibility to interact with electron photon group of the CMS, and contribute to the SUSY group. I also extend my gratitude to Dr. Rishi 
Patel, Dr. James Francis Hirschauer, and Prof. Meenakshi Narain for various interactions during the course of my PhD. 

My sincere thanks are due to Dr. Sourabh Dube \& Dr. Monoranjan Guchait to be members of the research advisory committee (RAC). Their 
availability whenever needed, regular feedback and inputs helped in timely completion of this project.

My special thanks to CMS collaboration and CERN for providing high quality
experimental setup and resources.

In this journey of 5 years, my institute, Indian Institute of Science Education and
Research (IISER) Pune, has been of great support. The institute and the Physics
department has provided very good environment, various research facilities and
also a constant financial support. The academic and non-academic activities at IISER made my stay very enjoyable. My sincere gratitude to the institute for all the help. I would like to acknowledge Department of Science and Technology, 
India for enduring financial support to carry about research on CMS experiment. I would also like to acknowledge Fermilab/LPC for 
supporting my visit which helped to get a broader perspective on CMS research. 


Thanks to Mr. Prabhakar Anagare, Ms. Dhanashree Sheth, Mr. Tushar Kurulkar and his team for helping with administrative work at IISER; IT 
department (Ms. Nisha Kurkure, Mr. Goldi Misra \& team), Mr. Brij Kishor Jashal and his team from TIFR for providing very good computing 
resources.

Last, but never the least, my heartfelt gratitude to EHEP group at IISER (Dr. Seema Sharma, Dr. Sourabh Dube, Ms. Aditee Rane,
Ms. Angira Rastogi, Mr. Anshul Kapoor, Mr. Arnab Laha, Ms. Bhumika Kansal, Dr. Kunal Kothekar, Mr. Shubham Pandey, Mr. Shubhanshu Chauhan and undergraduate students), friends
\& family for having lots of fun, discussions and supporting me at all times.

\begin{abstract}

Although many of the experimental observations can be theoretically well explained using the standard model (SM) of particle physics, the
SM is not complete because it does not explain gravity, dark matter and dark energy in the universe,
matter-antimatter asymmetry, nonzero neutrino mass, observed mass of the Higgs boson being much lower than theoretically favored value etc.
Supersymmetry (SUSY) is a well motivated theoretical extension of the SM which can address some of the issues in SM such as, Higgs mass 
problem and dark matter problem. In SUSY, every SM particle has a superpartner whose spin differs by half a unit. We have not yet observed 
superpartners with same masses as their SM counterparts which makes SUSY a broken symmetry. There are several theoretical mechanisms to 
achieve this symmetry breaking, and one of the mechanisms is gauge mediated SUSY breaking (GMSB). If GMSB is realized in nature, it 
typically results in events with one or more 
photons in the final state. A search for SUSY is presented based on events with at least one photon, jets, and
large missing transverse momentum produced in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data correspond to an 
integrated luminosity of 35.9 \fbinv and were recorded at the LHC with the CMS detector in 2016. The analysis characterizes signal-like 
events by categorizing the data into various signal regions based on the number of jets, the number of {\cPqb}-tagged jets, and the
missing transverse momentum. No significant excess of events is observed with respect to the expectations from standard model processes. 
Limits are placed on the gluino and top squark pair production cross sections using several simplified models of supersymmetric particle 
production with GMSB scenario. Depending on the model and the mass of the next-to-lightest supersymmetric 
particle, the production of gluinos with masses as large as 2120 \gev and the production of top squarks with masses as large as 1230 \gev 
are excluded at 95\% confidence level.

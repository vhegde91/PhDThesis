\chapter[SUSY search with photon]{Search for supersymmetry in events with a photon, jets, b-jets, and missing transverse momentum}
\label{Chap3}
\section{Introduction}
This chapter describes a search for SUSY in events with one photon, large missing transverse momentum (\ptmiss), 
and large hadronic activity.  The targeted production mechanism is described by simplified models of gluino and stop
production as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:SMS_diagram}, though the analysis is 
more generically applicable to other production scenarios.  This analysis
focuses on SUSY models in which R-parity is conserved forcing the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), to 
be stable weakly interacting, leading to potentially large \ptmiss.  


In general, gluinos and squarks will decay to at least one colored SM particles and the LSP through some number of
supersymmetric particles in the form of cascades.  Other SM particles, such as vector bosons or Higgs boson, can be 
produced in these cascades.  Massive SM boson decay predominantly to hadronic final states.  In particular, 
the Higgs boson decays predominantly to a pair of b-quarks.  In addition to heavy flavor from Z and Higgs bosons, 
heavy flavor quarks can come from top and bottom squarks.  These cases are particularly motivated by naturalness 
arguments, where squarks at least partially cancel the leading contributions of virtual corrections to the 
Higgs mass from SM particles (Figure \ref{fig:hierarchy_problem_higgs_mass_stop}).  

Given the reasons stated above, final states with high jet and b-jet multiplicities and at least one photon
are particularly well-motivated by the GMSB symmetry breaking mechanism and naturalness considerations.
Depending on the topology, these jets can arise from either light-flavored quarks (\cPqu, \cPqd, \cPqs, \cPqc) or {\cPqb} quarks. We study 
four simplified models; example diagrams depicting these models are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:SMS_diagram}.
Three models involve gluino pair production (prefixed with T5), and one model involves top squark pair production (prefixed with T6).
For the gluino models, we assume all supersymmetric particles apart from gluino, neutralino and gravitino, are very heavy (generally the 
mass is chosen to be 100 TeV) and inaccessible at the LHC. In the top squark model, we assume all supersymmetric particle masses
are very large, except the mass of top squark, neutralino and gravitino.
In the T5qqqqHG model, each gluino decays to a pair of light-flavored quarks (\qqbar) and a neutralino.  The T5bbbbZG and T5ttttZG models 
are similar to T5qqqqHG, except that the each pair of light-flavored quarks is replaced by a pair of bottom quarks (\bbbar) or a pair of 
top quarks (\ttbar), respectively. In the T5qqqqHG model, the \nuone decays either to an SM Higgs boson and a \grav or to a photon and a 
\susyP{G}.  The $\nuone\to\higgs\grav$ branching fraction is assumed to be 50\%, and the smallest \nuone mass considered is 127 \gev. In 
the T5bbbbZG and T5ttttZG models, the neutralinos decay to $Z\grav$ and $\gamma\grav$ with equal probability. The T6ttZG model considers 
top squark pair production, with each top squark decaying into a top quark and a neutralino. The neutralino can then decay with equal 
probability to a photon and a \grav or to a Z boson and a \grav. For the models involving the decay $\nuone\to Z\grav$, we probe \nuone 
masses down to 10 \gev. All decays of supersymmetric particles are assumed to be prompt i.e. the decays take place much before the first 
layer of detector.

\end{figure*}

In all models, the mass \grav is fixed to be 1 \gev, to be consistent with other published results of CMS experiment. 
To estimate the impact of \grav mass on the kinematics of photon and \grav, the mass of \grav was changed to 1 MeV and 1 keV. The \pt
spectrum of photon, the \pt of \grav and the transverse component of total momentum of gravitinos were found to be similar in all the
three \grav mass scenarios. The mass of gluino is large and hence \nuone has large momentum which 
results in high momentum decay products irrespective of 1 \gev or 1 MeV or 1 keV \grav mass.
The lowest \nuone mass considered for this study is 10 \gev. There \textit{may be} significant impact on the search if very low \nuone 
masses ($\sim 1\ \gev$) are considered. However in those cases, actual physics models instead of SMS need to be considered because the
branching ratio for $\nuone \to \gamma+\grav$ can be higher than 50\%. For the \textit{parameter
space explored in this search}, the kinematic properties do not depend strongly on the exact value of \grav mass.

This analysis is an extension of existing single photon analysis previously~\cite{Sirunyan:2017yse}, by taking full advantage
of \ptmiss, large hadronic activity, and heavy flavor content.  The analysis will search for large \ptmiss events
in various regions of jet multiplicity and b-jet multiplicity, motivated by several SMS scenarios.  The 
SM backgrounds are estimated from data control regions with as little reliance on simulations as possible.
Section~\ref{sec:mc-samples} discusses the SM and signal simulations used in the analysis.
The triggers used for both the signal and control regions are described in Section~\ref{sec:triggers}.   
Even selections are detailed in Section~\ref{sec:event-selection}. The background 
estimation techniques are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:bkgestimation}.  Signal systematic uncertainties are described in Section~\ref{sec:signal-systematics}.
Finally, results and a description of our statistical modeling of data and the inferred limits are described 
in chapter \ref{Chap4}.

\section{MC simulation samples}
\label{sec:mc-samples}
Monte Carlo simulation is used to design the analysis, to provide input for background
estimation methods that use data control regions, and to predict event rates from simplified models.
Simulated SM background processes include jets produced through the strong interaction, 
referred to as quantum chromodynamics (QCD) multijets,
\ttjets, \Wjets, \Zjets, \gjets, {\ttg}, {\tg}, and \Vgjets ({\PV} = Z, W).
The SM background events are generated using the \texttt{MADGRAPH5\_aMC@NLO} v2.2.2 or v2.3.3 
generator~\cite{Alwall:2014hca,Kalogeropoulos:2018cke,Artoisenet:2012st} at leading order (LO) in perturbative QCD,
except {\ttg} and {\tg}, which are generated at next-to-leading order (NLO).
The cross sections used for normalization are computed at NLO or next-to-NLO~\cite{Alwall:2014hca,Czakon:2011xx,Gavin:2012sy,Gavin:2010az}.
The QCD multijets, diboson ($\PV \gamma$), top quark, and vector boson plus jets events are generated with
up to two, two, three, and four additional partons in the matrix element calculations, respectively.
Any duplication of events between pairs of related processes---QCD multijets and \gjets; \ttjets and \ttg; \Wjets and \Wgjets---is removed using generator information.

The NNPDF3.0~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} LO (NLO) parton distribution functions (PDFs) are used for
samples simulated at LO (NLO).  Parton showering and hadronization are described using the \texttt{PYTHIA} 8.212
generator~\cite{Sjostrand:2014zea} with the CUETP8M1 underlying event
tune~\cite{Khachatryan:2015pea}.  Partons generated with \texttt{MADGRAPH5\_aMC@NLO}
and \texttt{PYTHIA} that would otherwise be counted twice are removed using the MLM~\cite{Alwall:2007fs}
and \textsc{FxFx}~\cite{Frederix:2012ps} matching schemes in LO and NLO samples, respectively.

Signal samples are simulated at LO using the
\texttt{MADGRAPH5\_aMC@NLO} generator and their yields are normalized using NLO plus next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) cross sections~\cite{bib-nlo-nll-01,bib-nlo-nll-02,bib-nlo-nll-03,bib-nlo-nll-04,bib-nlo-nll-05}.
The decays of gluinos, top squarks, and neutralinos are modeled with \texttt{PYTHIA}.

The detector response to particles produced in the simulated collisions is modeled with the
\texttt{GEANT4}~\cite{Agostinelli:2002hh} detector simulation package for SM processes. Because of
the large number of SUSY signals considered, with various gluino, squark, and neutralino masses,
the detector response for these processes is simulated with the CMS fast simulation~\cite{Abdullin:2011zz,Giammanco:2014bza}.
The results from the fast simulation generally agree with the results from the full simulation. Where there is disagreement,
corrections are applied, most notably a correction of up to 10\% to adjust for differences in the modeling of \ptmiss.
\section{Triggers}
\label{sec:triggers}

The analysis phase space is partly driven by the availability
of single photon triggers. We make use of two single photon triggers
for both the signal region and all control regions.  For the 
fake-rate background prediction, which relies on extrapolating from
single electron events, we also make use of single electron
triggers.  For validating the multijet backgrounds, where \ptmiss 
is dominated by jet mis-measurement, we make use of a zero 
photon control region, which is triggered using the inclusive 
\HT triggers.  

These three triggering strategies and studies of there efficiencies
are discussed in the following sections. 

\subsection{Signal triggers}

The signal events for are triggered using a logical \texttt{OR} of 
\texttt{HLT\_Photon90\_CaloIdL\_PFHT600} and \texttt{HLT\_Photon165\_HE10}
which require either a photon with $\pt>90~\gev$ photon and $\HT>600~\gev$, 
or a photon with $\pt>165~\gev$ respectively. In addition, photons need 
to have H/E $<0.10$.  Both 
of these triggers are seeded by level-1 triggers that are based on 
energy deposited in the ECal.  The trigger efficiencies are studied using 
MET dataset by taking \texttt{OR} of inclusive \ptmiss triggers : \texttt{HLT\_PFMET*\_PFMHT*\_IDTight}, where * corresponds to 90, 100, 110 \& 120.
Efficiency of the trigger is given by\\
\begin{equation}
\epsilon = \frac{\text{Events\ passing\ photon\ trigger(s)\ \& MET\ triggers}}{\text{Events\ passing\ MET\ triggers}}
\end{equation}

Figure~\ref{fig:photon165_eff} shows the efficiency of the \texttt{Photon165} trigger versus \ptg
for different data-taking eras and for all 2016 data. No conditions are imposed on kinematic variables, except that the events should have at least one 
photon with $\pt>100~\gev$. This trigger becomes fully efficient for $\ptg>190~\gev$ and has a plateau efficiency
of 97.6\%. 

\begin{figure}[htbp!]

  \includegraphics[width=0.48\linewidth]{../Figures/Chap3/triggers/photon165_eff_allEras.pdf}

  \captionsetup{width=.9\linewidth}
  \caption[Photon165 trigger efficiency]{Efficiency of \texttt{Photon165} trigger versus $\ptg$ for all eras (left) and split by eras (right).}
  \label{fig:photon165_eff}
\end{figure}

For measuring the efficiency of the \texttt{Photon90\_PFHT600} trigger as a function of $\ptg$, $\ST>900~\gev$ is used. To measure the efficiency as a function of \ST, $\ptg>100~\gev$ is used. Figure~\ref{fig:photon90_ht600_eff} shows the efficiency of the \texttt{Photon90\_PFHT600} trigger versus
both $\ptg$, for events with $\ST>900~\gev$ , and versus \ST ($\ptg + \Sigma_{\text{jets}} \pt^{\text{AK4}}$), for events with $\ptg>100~\gev$.  Efficiencies are presented both separated by eras and for all 2016 data combined.  The trigger is fully efficient for $\ST>800~\gev$, but has an inefficiency at high \ST.  
This inefficiency is ultimately recovered by the \texttt{Photon165} trigger.  The
\texttt{Photon90\_PFHT600} is found to be fully efficiency for $\ptg>100~\gev$
for high \ST events. At plateau, the efficiency is $>95\%$ as a function of \ST or $\ptg$.

  \label{fig:photon90_ht600_eff}
\end{figure}

The combined efficiency from the \texttt{OR} of the \texttt{Photon165} and 
\texttt{Photon90\_PFHT600} 
triggers is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:signalTriggers_OR}. This efficiency is measured by considering events with at least 2 jets and the following condition: (\ST > 500 \& $\ptg>190$) \texttt{OR} ($\ST > 800\ \& \ \ptg>100$).  The average efficiency
is found to be 98\% with a negligible statistical uncertainty.  The kinematic
dependence of the efficiency amounts to a roughly 2\% variation and is taken
as a systematic uncertainty, where relevant.

\end{figure}

The single (tight) electron control region, used for estimating the fake photon background, 
is also triggered using a logical OR of the \texttt{Photon165} and \texttt{Photon90\_PFHT600}
triggers. To ensure that there is no trigger bias in our estimations, we measure
the trigger efficiency for events with a single tight electron, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:signalTrigger_tightEle}.

    (right) for events with one tight electron.}
  \label{fig:signalTrigger_tightEle}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Multijet triggers}

Events with zero photons are used to validate the multijet background predictions.  These
events are triggered using an \texttt{OR} of the \texttt{PFHT800} and \texttt{PFHT900} 
triggers. The former HLT path is used only for the early data taking, and the later was 
used throughout 2016 data-taking without any prescaling. These triggers are observed to
be inefficient at high \HT. To recover this inefficiency, a single jet trigger is 
also included, \texttt{HLT\_CaloJet500\_NoJetID}.
The efficiency for these triggers is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:zeroPhotonTrigger_eff}, which is 
measured using events which 
pass the inclusive \texttt{PFMET*\_PFMHT*\_} triggers.  The efficiency is found to plateau
for at 98\% for $\HT>1000~\gev$.  The systematic uncertainty on this is taken to be +2\%/-1\%.

\end{figure}

\section{Event selection}
\label{sec:event-selection}
The search regions for the analysis require large \ptmiss,
large \ST, one high energy photon, and no leptons. 
Jets used in this analysis are reconstructed from charged-hadron 
subtracted  particle-flow (PF) candidates using the anti-$k_T$ 
algorithm~\cite{Cacciari:2008gp} with the distance parameter $0.4$. 
The PF algorithm is used to individually identify and reconstruct all particles
produced in the collision (PF candidates); namely charged hadrons, photons,
neutral hadrons, muons, and electrons~\cite{CMS-PRF-14-001}. 
The following requirements define the baseline selection:

\begin{itemize}
\item  $\ST>500\ \gev$ for events with $\ptg>190~\gev$,
 and $\ST>800~\gev$ for events with $\ptg>100~\gev$, where $\ST = \ptg+\sum_{\mathrm{jets}} \pt^{AK4}$.
The photon reconstruction and identification is described in the following.

\item Photons: 
Photons are selected using ID criteria described in \ref{sec:photonID}.
Photon candidates whose supercluster
is found to be in the pseudorapidity range of $1.44 < |\eta| < 1.56$, which is the EB-EE 
transition region are not considered.
Photons are required to have $\pt>100~\gev$
and $|\eta|<2.5$.

\item AK4PF jets used in this analysis are required to have $\pt>30$ \gev, $|\eta|<2.4$ and pass the loose jet ID requirements \cite{CMS-PAS-JME-16-003}: \\
  For jets with $|\eta|<2.4$:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item neutral hadron fraction $<$ 0.99,
  \item neutral EM fraction $<$ 0.99,
  \item number of constituents $>$ 1,
  \item charged hadron fraction $>$ 0,
  \item charged multiplicity $>$ 0,
  \item charged EM fraction $<$ 0.99
  \end{itemize}
  Jets that are matched to isolated photons, within $\Delta R<0.3$ are not subject to these requirements.   

\item Tagging of b-jets:

  Although not used for a selection criterion, the number of selected
  jets satisfying the combined inclusive secondary vertex b-tagging algorithm at the medium working
  point (CSVv2M $>0.8484$) is used as a discriminating variable \cite{BTV-16-002} and is used for deciding which signal region an event 
  belongs to.

\item $\ptmiss>200 \gev$ for signal region and the region $100-200$ \gev \ptmiss is used in estimation of \gjets background.
\item Angular cut:
  The majority of \gjets and QCD multijet events in our high-\ptmiss search region
  have jets with undermeasured momenta and thus a spurious
  momentum imbalance.  A signature of such an event is a jet closely
  aligned in direction with the \ptmiss vector.  To suppress this background, we reject
  all events in which either of the two highest-\pt jets lie within 0.3 radians
  of the \ptmiss vector in the azimuthal coordinate i.e. \dphi(\ptvecmiss, \ptvecjet) $<$ 0.3 for first two leading jets.

\item Muon veto:
  Muon candidates are selected using
  medium-ID muon selection \cite{Sirunyan:2018fpa} with the additional
  requirements:
  \begin{align}
    d_{xy}(\mu,\mathrm{PV}) &< 0.2\;\mathrm{cm}\nonumber\\
    d_{z}(\mu,\mathrm{PV}) &< 0.5\;\mathrm{cm}
  \end{align}

  Muon candidates are required to have $\pt>10\gev$ and $|\eta|<2.4$.
  To distinguish between prompt muons and muons from b-hadron
  decays, muons are required to satisfy an isolation requirement,
  $I_{\mathrm{mini}}<0.2$, where $I_{\mathrm{mini}}$ is the mini-isolation
  variable, whose description is similar to the one in \ref{sec:eleID} for electrons.
 Any event with a muon satisfying all of the  above criteria is vetoed.

\item Electron veto:

  Electron candidates are selected using very loose criteria on its properties, called veto selection.
  They are required to have $\pt>10\gev$ and $|\eta|<2.5$ and satisfy an isolation
  requirement of $I_{\mathrm{mini}}<0.1$. Any event with an electron satisfying all of the
  above criteria is vetoed.
\item Isolated track vetoes:
  
  Following the event selection described above,
  including the muon and electron event vetoes,
  there is still some background in the search regions from
  \ttbar, single-top, and W+jets events with one $W\rightarrow\ell\nu$
  decay.  In about half these background events, the W boson decays to a $\tau$ lepton
  and the $\tau$ lepton decays hadronically,
  while in the other half, an electron or muon is not identified
  or does not satisfy the criteria for an isolated electron or muon
  candidate given above.
  To suppress these backgrounds,
  we reject events with one or more isolated
  charged track.

  The requirements for the definition of an isolated track
  differ slightly depending on whether the track is identified
  as leptonic or hadronic by the PF algorithm.
  For leptonic tracks, we require:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\pt>5\gev$,
  \item $I_{\mathrm{tk}}<0.2$,
  \end{itemize}
  where $I_{\mathrm{tk}}$ is the scalar \pt sum of other
  charged tracks within $\dR<0.3$ of the primary track, divided
  by the \pt value of the primary track.
  For hadronic tracks, we apply slightly tighter requirements:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\pt>10\gev$,
  \item $I_{\mathrm{tk}}<0.1$.
  \end{itemize}

  Isolated tracks are considered only if they satisfy
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:mt_isotk}
    m_{T}(\mathrm{tk},\ptmiss) = \sqrt{2p_{T}^{\mathrm{tk}}\ptmiss(1-\cos\Delta\phi)}<100\;\mathrm{GeV},
  \end{equation}
  where $p_{T}^{\mathrm{tk}}$ is the transverse momentum of the track and
  $\Delta\phi$ is the azimuthal separation between the track and \ptvecmiss.

  To reduce the influence of tracks from extraneous pp interactions (pileup),
  isolated tracks are considered only if their nearest distance of approach
  along the beam axis to a reconstructed vertex
  is smaller for the primary event vertex than for any other vertex.

\item Event cleaning:

  We reject events with a jet that satisfies $\pt>30\ \gev$ and
  $|\eta|<2.4$ if the jet fails the loose jet ID criteria given above.
  We apply event filters designed to reject events with
  spurious \ptmiss signals \cite{CMS-PAS-JME-16-004}. 
  
  In almost all cases
  there is a jet matched to a photon within \dR $<0.3$.
  Since this jet contains photon plus the activity near it, $p_{T}^{\mathrm{jet}} \geq \ptg $.
  Any event which does not have a jet matched to the leading photon or the matching jet \pt
  is less than \ptg is also rejected. This criteria,  $p_{T}^{\mathrm{jet}} \geq \ptg $,
  helps in cleaning the data if there are any photon reconstruction failures (Appendix \ref{AppendixD}).
\end{itemize}

\section{SM background and search regions}
The dominant backgrounds for these high \ptmiss, single photons events typically involve either fake \ptmiss, from $\gamma$-multijet events, or leptonic 
decays of weak vector bosons, which produce neutrinos.  In electroweak events, photons can either arise from a genuine photon,
either prompt or non-prompt, or from an electron faking a photon.  While prompt and non-prompt photons are not distinguished
in this analysis, fakes from electrons are estimated separately.  Since photons can be produced from both simulations of
matrix elements and parton shower models, via Pythia, MC simulations are often broken up based on whether or not the matrix 
element includes photons or not. 

Figure~\ref{fig:baselineKineHist} shows the expected distributions of $\ptg$, \ptmiss, \nj, \nb, and \ST  for SM backgrounds and several signal points after the baseline selection mentioned in previous section.

Figure~\ref{fig:baselineEvtYield} shows the expected distributions of event yields for SM backgrounds and a few signal model points after the baseline selection. 
%A cut flow for each background process and two representative signals is shown in Table~\ref{tab:Cutflow}.\\
The final statistical interpretations are made using 25 independent signal regions. 
These regions are defined by \nj, \nb, and \ptmiss selections.  Six groups are defined  
based on \nj and \nb, they are listed in table \ref{tab:SR_bins} along with 6 sideband 
regions which are used for fake \ptmiss (\gjets and QCD multijet) background. The sideband regions are not used for
the interpretations.
Each of these regions, $N^{\text{b-jets}}_{\text{jets}}$, is further divided into 5 \ptmiss regions 
whose boundaries are defined by, $100<\ptmiss<200$ (sideband), $200<\ptmiss<270$, $270<\ptmiss<350$, $350<\ptmiss<450$, 
and $\ptmiss>450~\gev$.  In $N^0_{2-4}$ the highest \ptmiss bin is further split such 
that the highest \ptmiss region corresponds to $\ptmiss>750~\gev$.  
The first bin in each of the 6 groups in Figure~\ref{fig:baselineEvtYield} corresponds
to 100 ~\gev $<$ \ptmiss $<$ 200 ~\gev sideband used for estimation of fake \ptmiss background.

\subsection{Optimization of search bins}
The above signal region definitions were optimized by maximizing sensitivity to some of the SMS models shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SMS_diagram}.
For a given gluino mass if the mass of NLSP is close to mass of gluino mass, then the event has large \ptmiss and soft jets leading to low jet multiplicity. On the other hand, if the mass of NLSP is much less than mass of gluino, then there is small \ptmiss, but large hadronic activity leading to many jets in the final state. To cover both of these scenarios, search region is divided in bins of \nj, \nb and \ptmiss. Adding \nb binning along with \nj and \ptmiss bins gives higher sensitivity if there are any b quarks in the signal model. So these 3 variables are chosen to obtain higher sensitivity. 3 regions are defined based on \nj : 2-4, 5-6 and $\geq$7. These regions can be represented as $N_{2-4}, N_{5-6}, N_{\geq7}$. Each of these regions is subdivided into 3 regions based on \nb : 0, 1 and $\geq$2 (represented as $N^{0}, N^{1}, N^{\geq2}$). This gives total of 9 regions; all these 9 regions are further divided in \ptmiss dimension with the following bin boundaries : 100-120, 120-160, 160-200, 200-270, 270-350, 350-450, $\geq$450. In total there are 63 search bins. This binning can give very good sensitivity, but there will not be enough statistics in the control regions to predict the background. In this analysis, single electron $+\gamma$ control sample (CS), used for lost electron estimation, is one of the smallest control samples. These 63 bins need to be merged in \nj, \nb or \ptmiss to avoid too many bins with 0 CS events; without sacrificing too much on sensitivity. Different ways of merging the bins is studied and for each of them expected exclusion curve is plotted in figure \ref{fig:optCurves} for T5qqqqHG (left) and T5bbbbZG (right) models.

In the legends, numbers shown in subscript refers to \nj and superscript refers to \nb. These 63 bins are represented as $(N_{2-4}, N_{5-6}, N_{\geq7}) \times (N^{0}, N^{1}, N^{\geq2})$ with each of these regions subdivided into 7 \ptmiss bins.

In figure \ref{fig:optCurves}, red curve (corresponding to 63 bins) gives the best exclusion, but it has many bins with low CS events. Next best exclusion is obtained with orange curve which corresponds to 7 \ptmiss bins $\times$ 3 bins in \nj $\times$ 2 bins in \nb. Based on this scenario final search bins are determined. To increase the sensitivity for compressed scenario (mass of gluino is close to mass of NLSP), last \ptmiss bin in $N_{2-4}^{0}$ is further divided into 450-750 and $\geq$750~\gev.

These optimization studies are done based on MC samples, by considering MC statistical uncertainties and additional $20\%$ uncertainty for each bin and for each of the MC samples, including signal samples.

The final search region starts at \ptmiss $\geq$ 200~\gev, whereas in these studies, regions $\geq 100~\gev$ are also considered. This does not affect the optimization, since $100 < \ptmiss < 200~\gev$ region is background enriched and does not contribute to sensitivity.

In the legends, subscript $j$ in $N^i_j$ refers to number of jets and superscript $i$ refers to number of b-tagged jets. The red curve corresponds to 63 search bins defined as (\nj = 2-4, 5-6, $\geq 7$) $\times$ (\nb = 0, 1, $\geq2$) $\times$ (7 \ptmiss bins). Other curves are obtained by combining these 63 bins in either \nj or \nb or \ptmiss or any combination of these variables. The final binning of the analysis is based on  orange curve defined as (\nj = 2-4, 5-6, $\geq 7$) $\times$ (\nb = 0, $\geq1$) $\times$ (7 \ptmiss bins).}

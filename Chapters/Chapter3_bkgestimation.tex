In order to have a robust background prediction over all analysis bins, it is 
necessary to individually estimate the various background components since 
the composition is expected to vary dramatically in various bins (Figure \ref{fig:supp_Sim_Pie_lowMET}).
Low \ptmiss regions have more \gjets background, high \ptmiss regions with low \nj or \nb
is dominated by processes involving Z or W, and the high \ptmiss, high \nj, high \nb region is
mainly \ttjets or \ttg dominated.

There are four main sources of background events:  events with a lost lepton (lost e/$\mu$) or a hadronically 
decaying tau leptons, events in which an electron from a $W\rightarrow e \nu$ decay fakes a photon,
$Z\rightarrow \nu \bar{\nu}$ events produced in association with a $\gamma$, and fake \ptmiss events. 

The lost lepton background arises from events in which the charged lepton
from a leptonically decaying W, produced directly or from the decay of 
a top quark, fails to be identified by being out of acceptance, 
or failing the identification or isolation requirements.  For example, in events
with high \pt top quarks, the top quark decay products will be collimated, forcing the b-jet
to be closer to the charged lepton.  In these cases, events are more likely to 
fail the isolation requirements.  These events are estimated by studying events
with both a  well-identified photon and lepton ($e/\mu$) in both data and simulation.  

The hadronic-$\tau$ background arises from events in which $\tau$ leptons from 
W decays decay to mesons and neutrinos, which occurs $\sim 65\%$ of the time.  
Due to lepton universality, the fraction of hadronically decaying $\tau$ events 
can be estimated from single muon after correcting for reconstruction differences
and for the hadronic-$\tau$ branching fraction.  

Fake photon events primarily arise from electrons from W decays faking 
photons.  This can happen when a pixel seed fails to be associated with
the photon candidate.  Given a fake rate, which relates events with well-identified
electrons with events with well-identified photons, the fake photon background
can be estimated from a single electron (zero photon) control region.  The 
fake rate will be estimated in MC and data/MC corrections are studied to 
account for any MC mismodeling.

Invisible Z decays constitute a major background for low \nb or \nj multiplicity, high 
\ptmiss events.  These events have a natural counter part, Z($\mu\mu$) and Z(ee)
events, which can be studied in both data and MC to predict the Z($\nu\nu$) 
contribution.

Fake \ptmiss events occur primarily in events with a single photon and jets, 
where one of the jets' energy is mismeasured.  These events primarily
contribute to the low \ptmiss phase space.  These events are greatly reduced
by requiring events to have a large angle, in the transverse plane, between
\ptmiss and the leading and subleading jets, $\dphi>0.3$.  There are several control 
regions that will be used to estimate these events, events with zero photons, 
events with a photon, but after inverting the $\dphi$ cuts, 
finally, the whole method will be anchored to the high $\dphi$, photon
signal region with low \ptmiss. Region \dphi(\ptvecmiss, \ptvecjet) $>$ 0.3 for first two leading jets is defined as
high \dphi and low \dphi is the region with does not pass this criteria (one of the jets or both of the jets are aligned, \dphi$<$0.3, with \ptmiss).
